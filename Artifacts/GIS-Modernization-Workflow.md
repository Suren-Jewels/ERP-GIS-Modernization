# 🗺️ GIS Modernization Workflow

**Objective**: Upgrade and secure legacy GIS infrastructure for a government-backed enterprise using Linux and Oracle.

---

## Step 1 – Legacy Assessment
- Inventory existing GIS layers, formats, and access controls
- Identify bottlenecks in rendering, export, and user access

---

## Step 2 – Platform Upgrade
- Migrate GIS stack to hardened Ubuntu servers
- Install updated GIS engine with support for modern formats (GeoTIFF, Shapefile, KML)

---

## Step 3 – IAM Integration
- Define roles: GIS Analyst, Auditor, Operator
- Enforce access controls via config files and shell permissions
- Enable audit logging for layer access and exports

---

## Step 4 – Performance Tuning
- Optimize rendering engine and database queries
- Enable caching for frequently accessed layers

---

## Step 5 – Documentation & Training
- Create annotated user guides for GIS analysts
- Document IAM mappings and audit procedures

---

**Outcome**: Secure, performant GIS infrastructure with role-based access, auditability, and modern format support.
